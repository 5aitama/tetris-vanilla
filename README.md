## How to launch with VS Code `live server extension`

Most browsers won't allow file imports, for cross-origin requests reasons, so we got to access the entry point from a web server. However we don't want to configure apache or nginx just for developement purposes. I sujest you use the VScode [live server extemsion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

First of all clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Keksoj/tetris-vanilla.git
cd tetris-vanilla
code .
```

And click `Go Live`. The extension will launch a little web server that listens on `localhost:5502`, and will even open the page in your favorite browser.
